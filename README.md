## 📖 About

**XRTourGuide** is an innovative sub-project of the EU-funded [FUTURAL initiative](https://futural-project.eu/it/), focused on creating immersive virtual tours that enrich rural communities and enhance cultural heritage preservation. By combining Extended Reality (XR) technologies with Artificial Intelligence, XRTourGuide empowers local communities to create, share, and experience interactive tours of their cultural landmarks, natural sites, and historical treasures.

### The Challenge

Many rural regions rich in cultural heritage face significant obstacles:
- **Limited Accessibility**: Cultural sites struggle to remain open due to staff shortages and deteriorating infrastructure
- **Insufficient Services**: Lack of basic visitor amenities discourages tourism
- **Low Visibility**: Weak regional branding and promotional efforts keep areas "off the map"
- **Poor Information Dissemination**: Historical and practical information about sites is fragmented and hard to find

### Our Solution

XRTourGuide provides an online platform that enables communities to create and share immersive XR virtual tours, transforming how people explore and engage with rural territories. The platform combines:
- **Web-based Authoring Tools** for easy content creation
- **Mobile Applications** for discovering and experiencing tours
- **AI-Powered Visual Recognition** to trigger contextual information
- **Community Co-Creation** through active participation of local residents and organizations
